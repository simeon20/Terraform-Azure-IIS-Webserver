# Terraform-Azure-IIS-Webserver
Built an end-to-end Azure IaaS environment with Terraform, automating networking (VNet, Subnets, NSG), compute (Windows Server VM + Managed Disk), and security (Key Vault). Used storage-backed Custom Script Extension to bootstrap IIS, delivering a functional web server at deploy.
